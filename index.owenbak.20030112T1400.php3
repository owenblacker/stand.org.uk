<B>10th Jan 2003</B><BR>

Hands up everybody who's really excited about the
introduction of universal Identity Cards for every man,
woman and child in the country!
<P>
No?
<P>
Well, that can't be right. Lord Falconer says that in one of
the widest ranging <A HREF="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/dob/ecu.htm">consultations</A> conducted by a government,
<a href="http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page6806.asp">they've been fair swamped</a>
 with positive endorsements of
the Government's Entitlement Card plans. <P>
<B><I>With just a few
days to go before the end of the consultation, the Home Office is
saying that overall the public's reaction is hugely positive.</I></B>
<P>
The cynics amongst you might comment that that's because the
only people who have been really gee-ed up about <A HREF="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/cpd/entitlement_cards/complete_hi_r.pdf">downloading
a 13MB PDF</A> (<A HREF="http://www.isness.org/idcard/">here's the HTML version we knocked up</A>),
 scrutinising its every word and then writing up
their fascinating points of view are those with an axe to
grind about ID cards in the first place. Like the IT
companies who are desperate to sell the government a brand
new solution. Or the civil servants who've been hankering
after this massive simplification of their dozens of
databases for decades. Or the private companies like credit
agencies who would dearly love to have a single ID to store
all the data they're collecting on you.
<P>
Or, even, those in power who'd love to have a single place
they could find the name, address and personal details of
every person in the country or prevent them accessing vital
state services with a flick of a switch.
<P>
And we think you'd be right.
<P>
In fact, as a cynic - in particular, a cynic who uses
computers - we think you're desperately unrepresented in
this consultation.
<P>
We've listed some of the more cynical (and, we think,
accurate) truths about ID Cards for your consumption below.
If any of them meet with your gritty, realistic approval,
just tick the checkbox and click 'Next Step...'.  You'll see a draft of a
formal consultation response, drafted based on your
opinions. You can add or edit to it as much as you want. 
<P>
Confirm that draft, and we'll send your comments directly to
the Home Office's Entitlement Card Department and they'll
get incorporated into the final report.
<P>
Will it change much? Maybe: ID Cards are one of those ideas
that the public never votes on, but governments always
propose. When you're a minister, having an easy-to-get-at
list of everyone in the country sounds a terrific idea. But
when you find out quite how many people don't share that
opinion, you're tempted to think again. Especially when
those people are voters.
<P><A NAME="response"></A>
Oh, sure, that's us speaking cynically. But cynically
speaking, we think, is better than not speaking at all.<P>

<div class="titletomski">So, we've made submitting a response a simple 3 step process:</div>
