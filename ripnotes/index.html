<P>Well, <I>that</I> sounds innocent enough.

<P>This isn't a complete guide to RIP, or a complete guide to
the problems with RIP. What we're listing here are the same issues that
we've pointed up with previous legislation: proposals that sound perfectly
reasonable on first consideration, but which, in the light of modern
technology, turn out to be ridiculous, unenforceable, insidious or all
three.</P>

<P>We realise that some of the points we're making will seem obvious to many
of our readers. In our defence, we'll point out that they're can't have been
obvious to our politicians, otherwise they would never have allowed them to
reach this stage. There follows a summary (and more detailed explanation) of
the bugs we've found in the Bill so far. If you have the time to plough
through the bill yourself, we'd love to hear more. As a guide, you might like

<A NAME="summary"><H2>Summary</H2></A>

<A HREF="#isps"><H3>ISPs as wiretappers</H3></A>
<P>ISPs are now classified as "public telecommunication systems". As are mobile
telephone providers, Net gateways, newservers, and, potentially, operators of Web
applications like Hotmail. This provides a new set of burdens on even the smallest
ISP, and may introduce a new level of bureaucracy and liability for anyone
seeking to offer any form of Internet service. Additionally, employees of
these companies are compelled to keep any surveillance they conduct on their
customers secret in perpetuity. We believe this to be a dangerous extension of
obligations on British Net citizens, with no corresponding checks or balances
on law enforcement.<P>

<A HREF="#blackbox"><H3>Interception Methods</H3></A>
<P>Additionally, the Home
Secretary has reserved the right to demand the placing of specific devices to
monitor ISP traffic with little deliberation, and no guarantee that the
nature of this monitoring will ever be publicised. We'd like to see such
impositions made public.<P>

<A HREF="#certifs"><H3>Mass Surveillance</H3></A>
<P>The bill clarifies the requirements for an interception warrant, but also
provides for Certificates, which are general permissions granted
by the Home Secretary in a set of situations that don't make sense on the
global Internet. In particular, the security services can now attempt to
gather information on all communications that travel across an international
boundary, without limit. We believe this affects everyone who uses the Net, to
an extent unwarranted by the requirements of law enforcement.<P>

<A HREF="#secrecy"><H3>Permanent Secrecy</H3></A>
<P>Surveillance of communications, as before, is explicitly excluded from being
used in a court of law. While this ostensibly provides continuing privacy for
your e-mails (they won't be quoted in a court case), it also means that if
your communications are tapped, you will never know.<P>

<A HREF="#traffic"><H3>Traffic Data</H3></A>
<P>A wide group of government authorities are now allowed to collect
communications data - that's to say, everything about your Net sessions
*apart* from the contents of your messages. So, for instance, the Web sites
you visit or the full list of who you have contacted may be collected by
anyone from the local police to the security services, with very little
supervision. We think that collecting mass traffic data is effectively
watching your every movement online, and should have the same safeguards as
watching your home.<P>

<A HREF="#keys"><H3>Government Access to Keys</H3></A>
<P>The government can still demand you hand over keys or plaintext, and can still
potentially gaol computer users for being unable to unlock their own files.
This tipping-off offence provides serious criminals with a
get-out-of-jail-quick escape, while still effectively criminalising the
widespread use of encryption by making the act of losing keys or forgetting
passwords a criminal offence.<P>

<B><A HREF="http://www.fipr.org/rip/ripbillarch/ripfull.html#2" target="bill">2. (1)</A></B>&nbsp;In this Act-<BR>
"public telecommunications service" means any     
telecommunications service which is offered       
or provided to, or to a substantial section       
of, the public in any one or more parts of        
the United Kingdom;<BR>
"public telecommunication system" means any       
such parts of a telecommunication system by       
means of which any public telecommunications      
service is provided as are located in the         
United Kingdom;<BR>                                   
"telecommunications service" means any    
service that consists in the provision of         
access to, and of facilities for making use       
of, any telecommunication system (whether or      
not one provided by the person providing the      
service); and<BR>
"telecommunication system" means <U>any system       
(including the apparatus comprised in it)         
which exists (whether wholly or partly in the     
United Kingdom or elsewhere) for the purpose      
of facilitating the transmission of               
communications by any means involving the use     
of electrical or electro-magnetic energy.</U>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</SMALL>

<P>In other words, you're no longer using an ISP to connect to the Net. You're
using the ISP's public telecommunication system. And you're not using Hotmail,
or Hushmail, or Funmail, you're using their public telecommunication
service to read your mail. And the same, we imagine goes for public news
servers, WAP gateways, or - depending on how the judges call it, a Web hosting
company or colocation centre. And even if this definition is defined more
narrowly than our reading of the Bill, Section 11.(4) makes its requirements 
binding on:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<SMALL>
<B><A HREF="http://www.fipr.org/rip/ripbillarch/ripfull.html#11" target="bill">11. (4)</A></B>&nbsp;<BR>
<DIV CLASS="in">
(a) a person who provides a postal service,<BR>
(b) a person who provides a public 
telecommunications service, or <BR>
(c) a person not falling within paragraph 
b) <U>who has control of the whole or any
part of a telecommunication system located
wholly or partly in the United Kingdom, </U>
</DIV>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</SMALL>
<P>Which, frankly, could mean anyone with a phone.

<P>What does the Bill require of these people? According to Section 11. (4),
employees at companies offering a public telecommunications service (or a bloke
with a phone) are now obliged to obey surveillance warrants, or face a
maximum of two years in jail. According to Section 18. (2), employees also face
five years imprisonment for revealing the contents, details or even the
<I>existence</I> of a surveillance warrant. 

<P>There is no time limit on this imposition: nor is there a "whistle-blowing"
clause. 

<P>Suppose, for instance, you are Jack Futurestraw. As a prospective minister in
the cabinet of 2021, you want to pursue a case against the Blair government for
monitoring your youthful activities as a member of the Young Old Labourites
pressure group back in 2001. 

<P>It would be a criminal offence, twenty years on,
for anyone to either inform you that you were monitored, or appear as a
witness at the trial. 

<P>The only get-out clause for this secrecy is in the case where an ISP chooses
to prosecute the government, on its own behalf. Given that the major rights
being infringed are the subject of the warrant, not the ISP, this is unlikely
to occur (and given the criminal liability of the company before the case is
cleared, dangerous for any profit-making business to attempt).

<H4>Our objections</H4>
<P>This widens the number of people capable of being prosecuted for refusing to
serve a warrant considerably. One of the features of the Net is that
potentially, anyone can operate a "public telecommunications service" online. By widening the definition, the Bill is placing a huge liability on British companies to provide interception capabilities, which foreign companies do not have to comply with. We see great potential economic harm here.

<P>There's a subtler point here, too. Fast connectivity and server-based services
now mean that increasingly facilities that would hitherto been kept "on site"
are being will be moved off to remote locations, connected by a virtual private
network across the public Internet. For companies, this means that private
communications between individuals at a business (which would previously have
been kept within an office network) might be sent across the Net to
telecommuters. Obtaining this data would traditionally require a warrant,
served on the individuals. Post-RIP, these companies may be monitored without
their knowledge in order to "fish" for convictions, or monitor deals "in the
interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom"<SUP><A HREF="#note1">[1]</A></SUP>.

<P>Individuals, too, will suffer from this enlargement of the state's ability
to pry. If the government wants access to the data on your hard drive, they'll
have to inform you of their wishes with a warrant served on your doorstep. If,
though, they want access to your Mac's iDisk (a service provided by Apple which
consists of a online storage facility for temporary files), you will remain
ignorant of their actions.  Forever.

<P>The secrecy of the order makes sense during the period of interception, but
we believe there has to be a statute of limitations on such restrictions.
Otherwise, the extension of rights to require interception capabilities from
all service providers holds the potential for a dangerous enlargement of state
powers.

<H4>We'd like</H4>
<P>At the very least, a clarification that "telecommunication services" involve
communication between individuals, rather than offsite systems for the use of
one person. And a clarification, too, of what obligations the Home Secretary
considers "reasonable" to impose on service providers. Currently, (see <A
HREF="#blackbox">Interception Methods</A>), these requirements are left to
secondary legislation.

<P>Some mechanism to allow individuals to be aware of interception warrants, at
sufficient time subsequent to the action of the warrant that this publicity
doesn't restrict the action of the authorities in pursuing a prosecution. (See the notes under <A HREF="#secrecy">permanent secrecy</A> in this document.)

<P>And we don't see why anyone with a phone should get two years for refusing to
tap it themselves.</P>
<HR>

<A NAME="certifs"><H3>Mass Surveillance</H3></A>
<H4>See 8.(3) CERTIFICATES - or the outer "or"</H4>

<P>One of STAND's recurring worries is that each introduction of new powers for
interception creates a greater opportunity for mass surveillance. This was one of
our major objections to the government's previous key escrow proposals. In that
case, placing copies of many user's private decryption keys in a central
location would have made it much easier for determined groups to collect
intelligence en masse. One of the downsides of the unsecured Internet we use today is that, without sufficient safeguards, it makes it as easy to gather information on the public as a whole, as it does individuals (see also <A HREF="#traffic">Traffic Data</A>). Part of the intent of any bill to regulate the powers of
the security services should be to prevent this from ever happening.

<P>RIP seems to legislate against this possibility. Here's the clause:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>"External communications" means a message sent or received from outside the UK.
In other words, the Security Services have a mandate to monitor all incoming and outgoing international traffic, without regard to who it's from or to, merely under the control of the a general permission from the Home Secretary.

<H4>Our objections</H4>
<P>Now, let's consider this blanket permission in the light of the Internet.
How much of your everyday Net communications fall into this category? Do you
access your mail via Yahoo, or Hotmail, or Netscape? Do you use ICQ, AIM or
Napster? Do you subscribe to mailing lists, hosted on US machines? Do you buy
shares online at Charles Schwab, or E*Trade? Do you post to USENET? Do you read
USENET via DejaNews? Do you auction your goods on E-Bay? Do you use Compuserve?
Do you use AOL? Are you, or your family, ever knowingly looked at an foreign
adult site? And you absolutely sure that your ISP never routes your traffic via
Amsterdam, or New York as can happen when internal routes are congested?

<P>If so, congratulations. The Home Secretary has just granted the security
services and police permission to monitor you  - with almost no legal
oversight.

<P>After such strenuous efforts, aren't we getting paranoid? Why
would they want to monitor you, anyway?

<P>The simple answer is: they don't have to. All of the Net's international traffic passes through a handful of points. There, the security services (or the police, or a fistful of other authorities<SUP><A HREF="#note2">[2]</A></SUP>) can tap <I>everyone</I>. It's relatively easy to trawl through this, conveniently text-based, communications, monitoring for suspicious tidbits.

<P>Actually, it doesn't even have to suspicious in a criminal sense. Perhaps
it's commercially sensitive. interesting. If you're in business, you might like to
consider just how many of your deals with foreign companies may be construed
to effect "the economic well-being of the United Kingdom" - one of the
sufficient reasons for imposing a general tap order<SUP><A
HREF="#note1">[1]</A></SUP>.

<P>The structure of the interception warrant was designed to prevent mass
abuse of exactly this kind. On the Internet, that "external communications"
let-out renders this legal safeguard meaningless.

<H4>We'd like</H4>

<P>This has to go. In a globalized economy, it makes no sense to treat
communications with overseas companies differently from talking to a partner in the
next county. If the government wishes to tap international traffic, let it
use the same principles that RIP requires of monitoring internal
communications. The security services have to have specific warrants to target
individuals or locations. There can be no excuse for the mass surveillance of British citizens' everyday lives, no matter how distant their colleagues.

<P>ISPs, do not as a rule, monitor their own users. Section 12. (1) will oblige
them to invent the technology to do so, and build it into their equipment. For this act, the Home Secretary has gracefully agreed to reimburse them via a government grant.

<P>The current Bill makes no specification as to the what this equipment will consist of. 

<H4>Our objections</H4>

<P>It's not the cost we object to; it's the implicit weakening of security. Remember that "public telecommunication services" covers any number of Internet services. All of these will be obliged to provide a back-door for government interception. The 
security community on the Net has fought long and hard to remove any backdoors in <I>any</I> system, because of the high risk that such weaknesses will eventually be exploited for criminal ends. The Net is inherently, a very open, public and risk-laden environment. The only way to secure it is to work to making systems as invulnerable as possible.

<P>It seems clear from the tone of the rest of the Bill that the design of
these systems will remain closed, unless explicitly made public by act of law.
As we'll see later, in <A HREF="#secrecy">Permanent Secrecy</A>, the security
services prefer to work in the dark. Security from obscurity may be a useful
heuristic in the cloak-and-dagger world of MI5, but it's next to useless on
the Net. Time and time again, experience online has proven that the only truly
secure system is one that is open to scrutiny from security experts worldwide.

<P>This may sound like special pleading - or a request to deliberately weaken the government's surveillance capability. It's not. It's a practical truth, drawn from the thirty years of security lessons on the Net. If these instruments remain concealed, they <I>will</I> be cracked, or exploited for uses beyond their legal intent. As we've said, it's as easy to monitor everybody online than it is to monitor one person. In order for the technology of interception to not overstep its bounds, it has to be carefully constructed in full view of the security expertise of the Net.

<P>This is perhaps the hardest point to make to the Security Services - who we
can only address indirectly, since they refuse to make their own wishes clear
except by intimating them in the drafting of the RIP. Their principal modus
operandi - their secrecy - in this case can do nothing but harm their
capabilities. By cutting themselves off from the collective experience of
security experts worldwide, they risk making themselves obsolete.

<H4>We'd like</H4>
The Bill thoughtfully obliges the Home Secretary to consult with the experts in Section 12. (6):

<P>We'd like these considerations to be made publicly available, online. Particularly as our reading of the bill indicates that almost anyone can be considered subject to the obligations of monitoring their own Net communications. If the Home Secretary wishes to consult, let him consult everyone. That's possible, and desirable, in an online world.

<P>We rather suspect that this will be the hardest of our wishes to include in the Bill. Which is a shame, because it's definitely the one most determined to protecting the existing powers of the government.

<P>What does this mean? It means that surveillance data cannot be used in a
court of law. It means that the existence of a surveillance warrant cannot be revealed in a court of law. It means that surveillance can only be used to gather circumstantial evidence that will point to a conviction and not be the basis of the conviction itself.

<H4>Our objections</H4>

<P>It also means, once again, that if you are the victim of an illegitimate surveillance warrant, you have <I>no way</I> of ascertaining its existence. If there is a leak, you will be unaware of it (after all, only the paranoid would blame a collapsed business deal on a leaked tap, right? The paranoid, and <A HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/newsid_654000/654394.stm">the European Parliament</A>, that is.)

<P>We don't have a problem with surveillance data being inadmissible as evidence. We do have a problem with the complete inability of the Bill drafters to tolerate the release of the existence of surveillance warrants in cases of misconduct (or innocence).

<P>(You may like to compare this with the requirements on telecommunication service providers in our <A HREF="#isps">ISPs as wiretappers</A> section. There is simply no way anyone can discover that they have been tapped, no matter how long ago or how innocent they proved to be.)

<H4>We'd like</H4>
<P>Once again, we'd like a statute of limitations on the secrecy of surveillance warrants. At a certain point - perhaps as part of the Freedom of Information Act - it should be possible to discover whether you have, in the past, been the subject of surveillance.

<P>Dedicated readers of the Bill may, at this point, bring up the Surveillance Commissioner and the Tribunal (described in Part IV of the Bill). The Tribunal <I>is</I> permitted to discover the existence of warrants. It can investigate, and issues a yearly report of its investigation. Is that not enough?

<P>No. If it is impossible to discover whether you have been monitored, only the most determined citizen will call upon the Tribunal's powers. Also:

<P>In other words, you have only a year to feel the effects of a leaked surveillance, or note the damage to your business, or finally determine that it is a illegally-executed surveillance that has led to your problems.

<P>Once again, we suggest that these bizarre impositions on the public's right
to know relates to the existing culture of the security services. There's
certainly no practical reason why citizens should never discover that they
were tapped.

<P>There has been concern for some time online about the gathering of what is known as <I>traffic data</I> by commercial Net companies. Traffic data can best be described as the writing on the envelope of a message, rather than the contents. It can be the list of phone numbers you have called in the last six months. Or a full list of Websites you have visited. Or the times you log on, and from where. Or who you e-mail, or what programs you've downloaded, or what newsgroups you read.

<P>Companies like DoubleClick have got into trouble because while
this data is relatively easy to obtain, and is extremely valuable. Using
modern methods of data mining, it is possible to deduce a great deal about the
actions of a person from their traffic data. Even anonymously collected lists
of traffic can be matched to names over time. And as more and
more commercial and personal activity moves onto the Net, the picture of who
you are, what you like, and what you are doing, becomes clearer. The
unscrutinised collation of traffic data has been compared to stalking. Fortunately, in this country, the Data Protection Act does a reasonable job of preventing corporations from abusing this power.

<P>"Communications data", in this Bill, is traffic data. What oversight is placed on its collection by the government?

<P>When can traffic data be obtained?

<P>There is no warrant system for traffic data. Anyone of a high enough rank (the rank being decided by the Home Secretary) may obtain this data, with little oversight.
<H4>Our objections</H4>
<P>According to the new bill, any police officer or member of the security
service, may obtain details of which Websites you visited, who you have been
e-mailing, which newsgroups you visit, in the interests of detecting
crime. Not <I>serious</I> crime, mind you. Unlike surveillance warrants,
communications data can be for any detecting <I>any</I> crime.

<P>We can understand why the present government believes that traffic data should have weaker requirements, and a wider designation of authorised personnel. They're still thinking that it relates exclusively to obtaining a list of telephone numbers. On the Net, this isn't the case. There's a vast amount of information obtainable from the Security Services (or a sufficiently technologically adroit law enforcement body). Gross invasions of privacy await, and the power in traffic data will only grow as the Net becomes more pervasive.

<H4>We'd like</H4>
<P>We'd like the same authorising structure as is in place for covert human intelligence (Part II of the Bill, which we're not examining here, but covers stake-outs and spying). Collecting traffic data <I>is</I> like stalking - and needs the same safeguards surrounding its use by government bodies.

<H4>Our objections</H4>
<P>The government has appeared to learn nothing from its previous attempts to
pass these controls. We've gone into some detail on these issues before, so
we'll merely summarise the problems here.
<P>Time and time again, we've tried to get the government to understand that
strong encryption is <B>vital</B> to preserve business and personal secrets
online. If someone passes your secret key to any third party, all of your data
under that key is compromised. When a key is copied, it is impossible to
remain confident that it will not pass to others. The government places no
safeguards over the security of a key, once it has been passed on.
<P>Handing over a key should <I>not</I> be a trivial exercise. The potential
liability to companies and individuals of losing control of their private keys
is incalculable. Allowing any statutory body to demand these keys trivialises
the importance of encryption in the future of the Net. It is comparable to
allowing any government body access to the most private areas of citizens'
life.
<P>The government is in the habit of indicating that this bill is necessary to
defend against monstrous criminal acts. They claim that without it, drug
barons, child pornographers and terrorists will use encryption to evade paying
for their crimes. Usefully, this Bill <I>guarantees</I> that they will. If you
encrypt all your data, and refuse to hand over the key, you can be punished to
a maximum of two years (or six months). This makes it worthwhile for criminals
to pursue this aim, while actively dissuading regular citizens from taking the
risk that they will be imprisoned for being unable to decrypt their own data.
As the old Net proverb has it: if you outlaw encryption, only outlaws will use
encryption. Additionally, the defence of "forgetting your passphrase" will
quickly become discredited: making it even more difficult for innocent
citizens to use this as a legitimate defence.
<P>As we've pointed out before, the law also reverses the burden of proof.
While the new Bill introduces some safeguards (mainly to avoid the bug that
allowed us to <A HREF="http://www.stand.org.uk/dearjack/photostory.php3">stitch Jack Straw up</A> under the original
proposals), there are still plenty of situations when innocent citizens can be
forced to prove their innocence in court, rather than the other way around.
For examples of how this might occur, see Dr Lindsey's <A
HREF="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~chl/scenarios.html#scenario 16">lost or disused
keys</A> scenario.
<P>And, once again, the government has included a "tipping off" offence, which
makes it impossible to discover whether a warrant has been served by the
police, intelligence services, or customs and excise officers. This will have
little effect on the criminal (most keys are held personally, requiring a
warrant to be served on the criminal themselves). However, for a legitimate
business who inadvertently find themselves under a decryption order (in order
to decipher communications from a suspect), it effectively destroys the
privacy of anyone in communication with them (again, see Dr Lindsey's <A
HREF="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~chl/scenarios.html#scenario 11">Value of a
compromised key</A> for an illustration of this problem.

<P>There is no restriction on how long the key is kept by the
authorities. Even the surveillance warrants have a sell-by clause.


<H4>What we'd like</H4>
<P>Well, frankly, we'd like this section torn up. No government places such a
wide demand on access to keys. Even the technologically-advanced US admits
that no such requirement is yet needed, judging by the use of encryption in
crime. Successive governments since 1996 have attempted to obtain control of
their own citizens private keys. In all that time, the authorities have
declined to give concrete examples of when this power might actually have
been required.

<P>However, if the Bill is to become law, we'd like:
<P>In recognition of the importance of preserving confidence in keys, the
requirements made comparable with those required for an interception warrant.
<P>A provision- by those attempting to obey the warrant - that a plaintext
version of the communication will suffice (instead of the keys to decrypt it
and other files). The government has yet to give us an example where plaintext
would be unsuitable, and a key not, for the purposes of law enforcement.
<P>Tightening up of the burden of proof, so that no scenario can occur where
an innocent individual can be sent to prison for failing to prove a negative.
<P>Time limits on the "tipping off" offence and length of time the key can be
kept by the authorities, as well as stronger safeguards on preventing the key
from passing into the wrong hands (currently, officials have a simple "duty"
to prevent this. It should be a criminal offence to pass keys on.)

<P>This is only the beginning of Bills, written by non-Net users, that can
drastically effect your rights online and off. We need to educate our
politicans now of the
effect of their actions.

We'll be happy to link to other opinions on the Bill (pro and con). 
<H4>Act now</H4>
<P>Compared to previous government attempts, the RIP Bill has been introduced
incredibly swiftly and with little oversight. It has a strong chance of being
law by October 4th. You need to make your voice known now.

<B>"Government is too secretive. Too many decisions are
taken behind closed doors without proper consultation

be better informed about what government is up to, and be
consulted more."</B>
