# stand.org.uk
This repo contains the website files from the now-defunct www.stand.org.uk, most of which which I happened to have lying around on a server and the rest of which I fished out of the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/).

I resurrected some of the site at https://owenblacker.github.io/stand.org.uk/, which will show you the site homepage as at 11 April 2004, when we were busy fighting the Labour government's ID Cards proposal and manually updating a site that used the same skin as its predecessor site. The previous site version, built in [Moveable Type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_Type) and dated 10 January 2003 is, I'm afraid lost to the mists of time.

The version of the Stand.org.uk site before that, dated 10 June 2002 when we had just finished unsuccessfully fighting the [Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_Investigatory_Powers_Act_2000), is available at https://owenblacker.github.io/stand.org.uk/index.20020610.html and includes a [submission to the DTI Select Committee from around 2003](https://owenblacker.github.io/stand.org.uk/select.html) all the earlier [@dopt an MP stuff](https://owenblacker.github.io/stand.org.uk/faq.html) and my personal favourite, [Operation Dear Jack](https://owenblacker.github.io/stand.org.uk/dearjack/) and its [photostory](https://owenblacker.github.io/stand.org.uk/dearjack/photostory.html). Oh, and banners designed by [Charlie Brooker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Brooker):
