		<div class="entry-body"><p>There's still one question left hanging from the recent RIP Standing Order palaver. At the height of the debate, Home Office minister Bob Ainsworth suggested
that it was a fuss over nothing, as all the organisations listed in the order <i>already</i> had access to communications data.</p>
<p>We've been looking at the current legal position. Summary: Bob's right up to point, but the RIP order would have made it much worse.

	<p>This issue seems to have opened a can of worms which the government just wants to go away. I tried to fax my MP several times about this issue (RIP s.22) without success, so now I, and lots of like minded friends will write to him at The Commons. Mps not allowing faxes to their fax machines, whatever next? They've forgotten we can still write letters to them and the press have they.?<br />
Congratualtions on bringing this matter to the notice of the likes of myself. Your web site address is being circulated copiously.<br />

	<p>I too faxed my MP and this week I got a reply.<br />
I'm still in shock.<br />
Cynicism aside, my MP also happens to be a shadow Home Office spokesman so he didn't have much choice.<br />
I got a standard letter which had clearly been written just to constituents who contacted him about this issue. He quoted most of what I had written him back again - in case I didn't know - and went on to say what a great victory had been scored by all who opposed it.<br />
Well done peeps.</p>

	<p>I faxed our local MP, Nigel Evans (Con.  Ribble Valley), and received a very courteous response by return of post, noting his concern over the issue, and his opposition to it.</p>

<p>Well done indeed, Mr Evans.</p>
