  As most of you will already have heard, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk_politics/newsid_2051000/2051117.stm">the government has backed down</a> from
  the RIP s22 Order that would have given access to traffic data to dozens of
  government departments. We thought you'd like to know that this U-turn was
  largely down to you.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="http://www.faxyourmp.com/">FaxYourMP folk</a> say that they relayed 1789 faxes from last monday, and
  estimate that around 1600 of those were related to the s22 RIP Order. That
  means that, on average, every MP received at least two messages expressing
  concern over the measure.
</p>

<p>
  We've received mail from constituents saying that their Member of Parliament
  called them directly to discuss the issue. We've had MPs mail us with
  advice. We've had TV companies and newspapers contact us after they'd been
  hassled by their readers and viewers. We've even had MPs writing letters to
  constituents explaining, mournfully, that there was nothing they could do -
  and then had their own voters explain to them how to attend Standing
  Committee debates, and who to get in contact with others to help fight this
  order. Ah, those apathetic votees.
</p>

<p>
  Also, we had Hugh.
</p>
<p>
  One of the stories we've repeatedly heard is that the Home Secretary's
  change of heart came from a briefing by his 21-year old son, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk_politics/newsid_2051000/2051670.stm">Hugh Blunkett</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Hugh, like the rest of us, uses the Internet. He knows enough to see how
  dangerous this proposition was.  At some point - whether it was a forwarded
  messaage, or an announcement posted on <a href="http://slashdot.org/">http://slashdot.org/</a>, or a link on
  <a href="http://efa.sat4the.co.uk/">your Website</a> - Hugh found out about this order. He read the comments, and
  the objections posted by thousands of people online, and did something about
  it.
</p>
<p>
  Now, of course, it does help if your dad is the Home Secretary. But if
  there's one thing we've learnt from STAND, it's that people have greater
  access to the levers of government than they think. From you to the Home
  Secretary is a very short chain, and for practical purposes, we don't care
  whether it was via Hugh or David's old classmate at Huddersfield College.
  Someone explained to him how the rest of us feel.
</p>
<p>
  Making contact is important. The volunteers at STAND and FaxYourMP are
  almost pathologically cynical, but we're regularly taken aback by how
  positively MPs, editors, civil servants and peers of the realm respond to a
  personal contact by intelligent and reasonable citizens. It's almost as if
  they're flattered by the attention. It's almost as if they're touched anyone
  even cares about what they do.
</p>
<p>
  At the beginning of this campaign - oh, almost a week ago now - many people
  (from professional lobbyists to anonymous Web forum posters) told us that it
  was futile to encourage others to make a fuss. It was too late; that
  delegated legislation would be railroaded through; that no-one cared about
  privacy issues; that U-turns never happen.
</p>
<p>
  And perhaps we shouldn't get too cocky. Even this proposal has only been
  "postponed indefinitely", possibly only until the next Parliament after the 
  Summer break. And there are dozens of other bits of legislation hanging
  about with vast technological idiocies contained within
  - the RIP Act draft Code of Practices; the EU's Copyright Directive and Data
  Retention orders; laws against reverse-engineering; software patents and who
  knows what else.
</p>
<p>    
  But we thought it was worth saying that you won. And the next time you're
  talking to someone about these issues, and someone says "what's the point?"
  - well, you now may now point at yourself, and mention how you got the
  government to blink.
