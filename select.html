<H1>STAND SUBMISSION ON E-COMMERCE TO THE DTI SELECT COMMITTEE</H1>

<H3>INTRODUCTION </H3>
<P>
STAND (<A href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030621163448/http://www.stand.org.uk/">http://www.stand.org.uk</A>) is an exercise in online participation
in democracy. It consists of over three thousand volunteers from six
hundred constituencies who have offered to assist members of Parliament
in understanding the issues behind new information and communications
technology. While STAND does not act as a platform for a single
political viewpoint, participating members have expressed a broad
consensus on a number of technical issues.
<P>
The following written submission expresses our concerns regarding the
proposed E-Commerce Bill. We strongly believe it represents the
concerns of many others who - like us - depend on the Internet for
their business today, and are involved in creating the British
technologies of tomorrow.
<P>
This document was perforce written before the full consultation paper
was released by the Department of Trade and Industry. As such, many of
our comments are based on the formal briefing provided by Stephen Pride
of the DTI at the ICX conference in November[1]. We understand that
some details may have changed in the interim - particularly as the
consultation paper has now been delayed by several months. However,
most of our objections are based on what we believe to be the misled
grounding of the Bill rather than the implementation details. Whatever
the final form of this document, the principles we express here should
be applicable.
<P>
We will be releasing an updated version of this document, following the
publication of the consultation document in mid-February. [2]
<P>
I. Government Support for Key Escrow 
<P>
The proposals lend government support to the establishment of a
voluntary key escrow system for public key encryption on the Internet.
Key escrow systems require that the encryption keys used to protect
data in transit are placed in trust with a third party. Suggested third
parties include British Telecom, banks and other agencies that may
already be considered trustworthy by the public.
<P>
The customary explanation for key escrow is that it permits law
enforcement access to communications suspected of concealing criminal
activities.
<P>
We believe the voluntary escrow of communications keys fails to live up
to this expectation, and will have little effect on the control of
illicit activities on the Internet.
<P>
We believe it may, by weakening Internet security for those who adopt
it, actively increase criminal activity in the UK.
<P>
We believe that even voluntary support for such a system will damage
British business interests.
<P>
And we believe that the government's proposals unacceptably affects the
civil liberties of British citizens.
<P>
<H3>II. Failure to Deal with Stated Aims </H3>
<P>
Key Escrow and Law Enforcement 
<P>
Government support for key escrow will have little effect on criminal
activity on the Internet. There are many ways by which criminals will
transparently circumvent the law, without fear of detection or
prosecution.
<UL>
  <LI> Software providing inherently stronger encryption is already in
   widespread use on the Internet, for business and for personal use.
   This software is readily available, and costs nothing. The details of
   how to write this software from scratch are readily available in any
   bookshop; these details are sufficient for any competent programmer
   independently to implement their own version. It is extremely
   unlikely that Government support would encourage criminals to switch
   to commercial software that deliberately leaks their private keys to
   a third party.
</UL>
<P>
 Furthermore the implementation of a key escrow system provides numerous 
 <EM>opportunities</EM> for criminal activity that would otherwise be impossible:
<UL>
  <LI> When keys are maintained in centralized databases, the investment
  required by criminals to obtain secure information is dramatically
  minimized. Such a repository would represent too good a target to
  resist, as any successful infiltration could provide access to large
  numbers of keys with which to unlock (without detection) large amounts
  of data.
  <LI> A customary method to improve the security of encrypted
  communications is to change a company's encryption key regularly. Many
  contemporary encryption systems use a different private key for each
  communication session. By prescribing key escrow, the Government will
  be supporting a standard that is profoundly weaker than this commonly
  used practice. Either the keys will have to be kept long after the
  communication has completed - a dangerous and unnecessary weakening of
  the current practice - or the keys will have to be transmitted to a
  third party simultaneously with the encrypted transmission. Both
  solutions considerably increase the chances of a key passing to
  unauthorized third parties.
</UL>
<P>
Finally, evidence has not been submitted to the public regarding
scenarios in which the new key escrow system would aid the apprehension
of criminals. In a recent announcement by the National Criminal
Investigation Service [3], several case studies were presented of
criminal activity which involved encryption. The NCIS Director General,
John Abbott, implied that these cases would have been easier to solve
within a key escrow regime. However, all the examples given involved
local encryption of permanent data. Such encryption would be possible
(and not unlawful) in the regime following the new law, and would be
unaffected by the proposals.
<P>
<H3>III. Harmful Effects on British Business </H3>
<P>
Government support for key escrow profoundly impacts Britain's position
in the global marketplace, not just for encryption products, but for
all goods and services traded via electronic commerce. While the
Government's proposals insist that the system will be voluntary, it
must be understood that British companies providing encryption
services will be encouraged to develop key escrow systems in preference
to more secure methods.
<OL>
  <LI> Damage to British Companies Creating Cryptographic Products 
</OL>
<P>
Despite the government's assurances, support for key escrow does favour
one technical system over another.
<P>
Certain additional requirements being mooted (such as dual-ended
access) effectively prescribe a particular encryption algorithm. Even if
these are dropped, key escrow necessarily favours certain technical
systems over others because most encryption systems in widespread use
do not support key escrow. Furthermore, because key escrow is a
political requirement that inherently reduces data security it is not
incorporated into the strongest systems. It is therefore fair to say
that the most effective systems are the ones most discriminated against
by these proposals.
<P>
Moreover, Britain is currently one of the centres of excellence in
non-escrow systems: Microsoft's centre at Cambridge for instance, was
formed to take advantage of the cryptographic expertise there, and also
of a legal export regime that was more welcoming than that of the
competing United States. To settle on a key escrow system here when
other countries are standardizing on stronger encryption will damage
the ability of these companies to compete in the global market.
<P>
b. Damage to British Businesses Supporting E-Commerce 
<P>
The Internet is a remarkably fluid and responsive marketplace, but most
companies are understandably suspicious of its lack of in-built
security controls. Our experience suggests that business will freely
move to sites and software that gives security the highest priority.
With the government proposals in place, these sites, this software,
will not be created in Britain.
<P>
c. Damage to British Consumer Confidence in E-Commerce 
<P>
Key escrow is a weak security system, both technically and in its
appearance to the consumer. Internet users already express a lack of
confidence in the security of their online transactions. The knowledge
that the key to all their transactions is being sent to a third party
will do nothing to improve that confidence.
<P>
d. Damage to the Competitiveness of E-Commerce Transactions 
<P>
Enforcing a key escrow system is cumbersome and costly to maintain.
This cost will, in the highly competitive world of electronic
commerce, be passed onto the consumer. British products and services of
all kinds will therefore incur excess costs beyond those of competing
nations.
<P>
In the words of some of the most respected experts in this field,
including two of the creators of the public key encryption system, as
well as experts at Microsoft, AT&amp;T, Cambridge University, MIT, and the
Stanford Research Institute:
<P>
    The deployment of key-recovery-based encryption infrastructures to
    meet law enforcement's stated specifications will result in
    substantial sacrifices in security and greatly increased costs to
    the end-user. Building the secure computer-communication
    infrastructures necessary to provide adequate technological
    underpinnings demanded by these requirements would be enormously
    complex and is far beyond the experience and current competency of
    the field. Even if such infrastructures could be built, the risks
    and costs of such an operating environment may ultimately prove
    unacceptable. In addition, these infrastructures would generally
    require extraordinary levels of human trustworthiness. [4]
<P>
e. Damage to the Standardisation of Internet Commerce 
<P>
Standards for secure communication on the Internet already exist [5].
Support for these standards by the British Government would help build
confidence. No currently promoted system for secure communication
advocates key escrow, nor is it likely to, given the overwhelming
objection to such systems by computer security experts. Encouraging
companies to develop new standards, incompatible with the accepted
protocols of the Internet, will slow market growth. At best, the
Government's support for voluntary key escrow will be ignored by
business. At worst, it will confuse matters irrevocably, and retard
Internet e-commerce in this country well into the next century.
<P>
If, as seems likely, Britain accepts the inevitable insecurities of
key escrow while the wider Internet adopts truly secure e-commerce
protocols, then a British business's software for accepting money
simply will not be compatible with an international customer's
software for spending it; that customer will go elsewhere.
<P>
<H3>IV. Harmful Effects on Civil Liberties </H3>
<P>
STAND is concerned that within the initial DTI discussion it was
proposed that the new Bill "clarify" certain powers of law enforcement
with regard to obtaining encryption keys. Although these clarifications
are somewhat unclear to us at the moment, we would like to highlight our
objections to some of the suggested contents.
<UL>
  <LI> Private keys to encrypted communications may be obtainable using a
  simple PACE warrant, requiring only the permission of a senior police
  officer. 
  
</UL>
<P>
  This implies that they are to be treated as stored data,
  rather than as part of a communication - which would require a Home
  Secretary's warrant under the Interception of Communications Act. We
  would believe the natural interpretation is the exact opposite. An
  encrypted message is a communication. Access to its key demonstrates
  an ability (and intent) to intercept that communication. If law
  enforcement wishes to obtain communication encryption keys, they must
  be subject to the same level of parliamentary scrutiny as would occur
  if they were tapping a telephone. The privacy of e-mail and the
  privacy of a private phone call is, in our belief, equivalent.
<UL>
  <LI> The introduction of a new criminal offence of revealing to a
  surveillance target (who may not be a suspect in any investigation but
  merely be supposed to be in possession of information required by the
  enforcement official) that his or her key has been passed on to law
  enforcement officers.
</UL>
<P>
  While we understand the reasoning beyond such a move, we find it
  disquieting that no parallel obligation has been included, requiring
  the such surveillance to be revealed as having occurred after the case
  has been closed (and a suitably short period of time has elapsed).
  Given the ease by which key escrow allows the transparent surveillance
  of a large number of suspects, we believe that such a check is an
  absolute necessity.
<P>
We strongly believe that these measures do not clarify existing
practice; they place electronic communications and commerce under a
different, and more oppressive framework than the status quo.
<P>
Moreover, they have no place in a Bill intended to primarily encourage,
standardise, and promote electronic commerce. We do, however, recognize
that a formal statement of the powers of enforcement officers in this
area would benefit the police and civil service compliance officers,
business interests, and civil liberties. We suggest that a better
placing for these issues is in a Bill devoted to lawful access to
traffic, namely the Home Office's current consultations on an updating
of the 1985 Interception of Communications Act.
<P>
<H3>V. Summary </H3>
<P>
STAND members represent a broad cross-section of political opinion, but
we are all united in our practical understanding of how the Internet is
used today in business and everyday affairs.
<P>
Our combined experience suggests that government support for a key
escrow system will damage the fledgling Internet business in this
country, and harm the civil liberties of innocent British citizens,
while doing nothing to assist law enforcement in apprehending
criminals.

to speed business and public undertakings in the United Kingdom. The paper
document was written, vetted, corrected and authorised by the three thousand
or so members of STAND, in less than one week.

<P>
A UK or European key escrow scheme would make life very hard for us. As
a software house working mainly for US companies we depend upon strong
cryptographic email and encrypted network connections. The US commercial world
will have no faith in the UK government proposals. We will lose business, 
and in fact may well have to move the company to the USA to remain viable.
I do not believe we are an unusual case.

I am a senior web producer for the biggest Web design agency in the world

am now actively advising all my e-commerce clients (to date including
Prudential Corporation, Virgin Direct, Hodder &amp; Stoughton, The Economist, EMAP
Finance, Zurich Reinsurance, International Risk Management Magazine &amp;
Reinsurance Review Magazine) in the strongest possible terms that they should
postpone indefinitely all plans for e-commerce if key escrow is implemented, as
this scheme represents unacceptable and uninsurable levels of risk both to
themselves and to their clients.

It seems to me that the key escrow notion is misconceived. One effect may be to

advantage we would normally enjoy in this area as an English-speaking country.
<P>
Rory Sutherland, OgilvyInteractive
<HR>
<P>
I find the current approach to key encryption extremely concerning, for two
entirely different reasons. 
<P>
From a commercial perspective, I believe that foreign businesses, who
necessarily conduct a number of their activities in conditions of
commercial secrecy, will be deterred from transacting some types of
perfectly legitimate business within, with, or through the UK due to
concerns over the possible access to and misuse of this information by
individuals or government agents with an interest in such transactions. As
a result, I believe the approach suggested will be severely detrimental to
the UK over a period of time, given the exponential growth of
Internet-based commerce.
<P>
From a personal perspective, I have grave concerns over the approach of a
government - any government - which feels that the ability of any of its
citizens to act of their own volition in manners which cannot be monitored
by such a government is a matter of national concern. This is an intrusion
into the privacy of the individual and an infringement of civil liberties
(already poorly protected by law in this country), and is reminiscent of
the bad days of the Soviet Union, or possibly the Orwellian visions of
1984.
<P>
As a result, I urge most strongly a review of the current government
approach.
<P>
Nicholas Coote, Principal, Mazro Consulting

<P>
The whole concept of key-escrow is abhorrent to any free-thinking 
society. I view the whole proposal as an avoidance of the real problems 
which are used by the DTI to support key-escrow. I fully support the 
STAND's campaign against the move.
<P>
Andrew Gretton, ISDN Advisor, Edinburgh, Scotland

<P>
Whilst I appreciate the concerns for valid law enforcement, I am utterly
opposed to key escrow. There is an effective, tried and tested method for
obtaining personal and confidential information in a criminal investigation:
judicial warrant.  This is, in my opinion, the ONLY system which will maintain
the balance between legal access and personal privacy.

I am a computer professional and the designer and builder of mass market
word-processing software in the 80s and mass market Internet access
software in the 90s. Millions of people have used my software. If they
asked my opinion of key escrow I would have to tell them that using such
a system was a totally unnecessary risk. Usually when the government
endorses a technology you know it is good. Since they only propose to
license escrowed schemes you'll still have a measure of quality, and
that will be to avoid the official schemes. Keys will hemorrhage from
escrow holders through mistakes, system failure and outright corruption.
I call it "licensed to leak" and advise everyone to use a reliable
encryption system instead.
<P>
Richard Clayton, Internet Expert, Demon Internet Ltd
<HR>
<P>
Any plans by the DTI to sponsor the key escrow system is the equivalent of
handing your door keys, passwords, and all your communications to the
government. In my opinion such a proposal is a threat to civil liberties as no
"trusted third parties" exist. Information Systems are insecure by nature, and
there will always be people with access to such systems from within so-called
"trusted" organizations.
<P>
Sebastien Lahtinen, Director, NetConnex Ltd.
<HR>
<P>
As a long term Internet user, who takes a keen interest in legislation
affecting citizens rights I view with increasing concern the DTI's plans to
sponsor the escrow of private keys. This proposal is, in my opinion, a
dangerous threat to civil liberties and could well hinder the development of
e-commerce in the U.K. to the detriment of British companies and
entrepreneurs. It is already the case that
 extremely powerful software providing unbreakable encryption is already in
widespread use on the Internet, for business and for personal use. This
software is readily available, and costs nothing. It is extremely unlikely
that government  support will encourage criminals to switch to commercial
software that  deliberately leaks their private keys to a third party. 
This being the case I hope you will think again about the proposed bill which
is unlikely to solve any of the problems it was designed to deal with.

As a senior IT and business consultant to a major British international
investment bank, I am extremely concerned about the proposed legislation.  In
particular I believe that Britain is now in a perfect position to profit from
the growing Internet commerce - so long as no ill-considered bills such as
this are passed. Please read the STAND document, and please listen to
knowledgeable and concerned constituents such as myself.
<P>
This bill will, categorically, catch no criminals.  It will, categorically,
drive commerce away from this country.

Peter Stephenson, Marylebone
<HR>
<P>
I suggest that MPs do the following: (1) place all of their bank account and
credit card details, including PIN numbers, into one database held on the
computer of a trusted third party, (2) announce that this had been done, (3)
see how long it was before a hacker had gained access and put himself in a
position to defraud any MP at will.
<P>
Should this proposal seem worrisome then the Key Escrow proposal should be
absolutely alarming.
<P>
I transact business on the Internet on an almost daily basis and I certainly
would not do business with any company which put the encryption key into a
third party database which would, in practice, be begging to be broken into.

other problems with the DTI's position, other than to say that I do of
course agree with STAND. I am simply going to say that I don't
understand how a responsible organization like the DTI can ignore such
an overwhelming deluge of common sense from so many different and
diverse organizations. Please have the courage to re-examine your
opinions and think again about condemning our country to the backwaters

As an information technology professional, I have viewed with increasing
concern the DTI's promotion of key escrow technology, for the following

1. I believe that the key recovery systems suggested constitute an
unwarranted infringement on the individual's right to privacy.
2. I believe that they will damage electronic rather than promote
electronic commerce in the UK.<BR>
3. I believe that they will promote opportunities for crime rather than
prevent it as suggested.

I personally would not feel safe entrusting, what is in effect, my email

Salim Fadhley, Internet Marketing Consultant, East Dulwich
<HR>
<P>
It is with great concern that I hear of the DTI's plans to sponsor the
escrow of private keys for public key encryption systems. While it is true
that I rarely have the need to send encrypted e-mail, it nevertheless
strikes me as a fundamental blow to civil liberties and personal privacy to
attempt to control it. Moreover, I can see no defensible argument which
would indicate that such a move is likely to reduce criminal activity on
the Internet. The only thing it might achieve is to severely hamper the
growth of Internet commerce, a new and important potential contributor to
our economy. Unfortunately, it is all too indicative of an increasingly
over-weening state, where the freedom of the individual is becoming
subservient to government and police, and where the law-abiding citizen
is treated as guilty by implication, simply from a desire for privacy. It
is a direct attack on our ancient rights, where the citizen is presumed to
be innocent until proven guilty. I would contend that any government which
attempts to restrict freedom in this way is infringing on basic civil
liberties, and I would expect the legality of such a move to be challenged
in the courts, as it was, successfully, in the USA.
<P>
Paul Spring, Software Consultant, Cambridge
<HR>
<P>
As a company that provides services to users of the Internet, I strongly
disagree with any involvement by the UK or any other government to encourage
organizations to supply security key information to any third party.
<P>
It is the responsibility of each user of the Internet to prepare sufficient
security procedures to govern any materials which are either broadcast via
the Internet or made available on the Internet.
<P>
To rely on third party controls could lead to both misuse and potential abuse of
security control.
<P>
The ethos of the Internet is: "a free and open environment for people to share
ideas and information". As more and more people use the Internet it is
necessary to maintain this freedom to allow natural growth in the forms of
usage. Any government involvement to inhibit access or to stem this growth
will prove both counter-productive and potentially inhibitive to the nation's
access to such an exciting and innovating environment.
<P>
Jeff Turner, Middleworld Limited
<HR>
<P>
As a computer consultant, I work with a lot of companies in
implementing their e-commerce and security strategies.  Key escrow is
a concern to these companies from a commercial standpoint, and also
worries me personally.
<P>
Central to any computer security strategy is the notion of trust.  Key
escrow makes legitimate security impossible for companies as they are
obliged to greatly increase the risk of their keys falling into
hostile hands.  In addition, it is very unlikely that key escrow will
have any affect on criminal activity other than to make it simpler for
criminals to obtain the keys belonging to legitimate businesses.
<P>
The proposed e-commerce legislation will affect me on a daily basis.
It is in the nature of e-commerce that the business can be situated
anywhere in the world, so long as it has a suitable IP feed.  The
proposed legislation will make it impossible for me to recommend the
UK as a base for e-commerce, as international businesses will find it
far easier to guarantee the security of their transactions abroad than
in the UK.
<P>
Sean Hunter, Consultant
<HR>
<P>
What the authorities seem to be failing to grasp, or at least
appearing to, is that someone involved in criminal activities will
not hesitate for a moment to add the offence of using a possibly
unlicensed and/or prohibited encryption systems to any other offences
they may have committed or intend to commit.
<P>
Forcing consumers and businesses to use any particular encryption
systems will damage the ability of the UK to compete in the worldwide
marketplace that is the Internet, and will not in anyway pose any
threat to the well organized and funded criminal.
<P>
Also, the challenge to the basic civil liberties of the UK electorate
is far too direct to be ignored.
<P>
Peter Galbavy, Director, Knowledge Matters Ltd.
<HR>
<P>
In my capacity as an IT Professional and Internet Consultant, I feel it my
duty to voice my opinions regarding the DTI's proposed sponsorship of a
key-escrow based encryption technology for any and all Internet transactions
from e-mail to the transmission of business sensitive financial data and
stock orders, just some aspects of e-commerce.
This proposal will support what I believe strongly to be a flawed, insecure
and frankly financially dangerous to industry, method of securing electronic
data for transmission via a global, public medium.
The idea that this could help in Criminal Investigation strikes me as being
optimistic at best. Criminals won't stop to think "Oh, but I must use a
government approved encryption system to encrypt my email to the IRA about
next week's bombing attempt". Those criminal elements who have things to hide
aren't going to be put off by a bill saying "Using non-approved encryption
systems will be a criminal offence" because they already are committing a
criminal offence, and they don't want to be caught at it.

As an accountant with a national public house company I view with increasing
concern the DTI's plans to sponsor the escrow of private keys. This
proposal in my opinion is a dangerous threat to both civil liberties and
the development of electronic exchange of information.  I regularly
communicate with members of my company and my home e-mail address
sending information I would be uncomfortable knowing others could see it
as a matter of right.  Whilst I accept that it is by no means a 100%
safe method of communication at least currently only the most determined
can access this data.

As the system administrator and head developer of a company involved
in developing E-commerce systems for several overseas and multinational
companies, I am deeply concerned that the key escrow policy threatened
in the DTI's E-commerce bill, which would lose us our clients to fears that
their confidential data may be read by a foreign (to them) government, 
by criminals (e.g. insider traders) briefed by leaked information, or by
crackers (aka hackers) who have compromised the trusted 
third parties' systems.

Secondly any government restriction in our choice of encryption
systems would affect our competitiveness in terms of costs but
more importantly in our ability to react to the rapidly changing state
of the art in encryption technology and science.

The DTI's proposals to ensure wide-spread key escrow are of great concern 
to me - as a product architect for software that absolutely requires the 
use of encryption for secure management of data networks, I am convinced 
that limits on encryption can only damage the growth of this and other 
software markets.  In addition, I am a frequent user of e-commerce, where 
key escrow will make it impossible to trust the encryption used for secure 
transactions, with the result that the UK's fledgling e-commerce sector will 
be forced off-shore.

As someone involved in human rights and international justice campaigns
relating to the Middle East, secure transmission of information from
people suffering abuses is essential, as is the distribution of news to
organizations and individuals campaigning against oppression by their
governments.  ESCROW arrangements hinder the private communication taking
place and puts people in other countries at risk, since the possibility
of keys being transmitted to foreign governments would exist.  It also a
gross infringement to civil liberties and freedom in this country.  It
will seriously affect all Internet communications and damage faith in the
practicality of this medium.

<P>
In a climate where increasingly countries worldwide are enshrining the right
to secure encryption within their legal systems and the "security" standards
of the only major power to evangelise key escrow are routinely broken as a
demonstration of their weakness I have to state my vehement opinion that any
move towards key escrow or limited encryption strengths of any kind can only
undermine both expansion of trade and the rights of the individual, whilst
doing nothing to prevent the use of strong encryption within the criminal
fraternity.  [1]
<P>
The companies I work for handle data worth hundreds of millions. When
protecting data of that value the relatively tiny cost of breaking a weak
link, whether it be by obtaining an escrowed key from a repository or building
specialized "brute force" decryption / key recovery hardware for standards
weakened <EM>in any way</EM> is well within viable spend of those who wish to obtain
such data and are considerably more aware of the reality of data-security than
those who appear to be driving the proposed legislation.  [2]
<P>
These are not hypothetical situations or the concerns of a minority
technological elite. They are the facts of a reality which affects, directly
or no, this countries economic prosperity and as a result the majority of
population.
<P>
[1]  DES, The US data encryption standard, was broken within 24 hours
recently.  Third party key escrow itself placing an entire corporations data
security within the hands of another corporation is simply not acceptable, for
hopefully obvious reasons.

[2] The minimal investment of hundreds of thousands of pounds when dealing
with values of this size is not a deterrent.  Sums far higher are well within
the bounds of economic viability.

As a qualified computer professional, Internet developer, long-term

do the mechanisms proposed not achieve the stated aims and have worrying

benefits for law enforcement and national security, but I believe that 
in the form of the proposals already publicized it will severely damage 
the UK economy.
<P>
When the UK is at the forefront of technical development in a successful 
regulatory environment it seems illogical to cast aside that advantage. 
Price differentials for Internet commerce already favour other countries 
and crippling the potential for ecommerce in this way will leave the UK

The Internet is our preferred delivery system for all our information

&pound;100,000 to &pound;150,000 per annum on Internet delivered services. However, if
they are to continue to be able to supply us in this way it is essential
that the security of the data with which they supply us is maintained.
<P>
It is a simple fact that the more people who know something, the less secure
it is. No amount of safeguards will change this. If Internet business are
not able to maintain the tight security they need from the UK, then they
will simply move somewhere that they can. At the moment nearly all our
suppliers are based in the UK, but there is no technical reason why they

As technical director of an accounting software company I find the 
current proposals for key escrow disturbing and somewhat 
pointless. I for one would not advise our customers to trust a key 
escrow service for security. Any system where the highest required 
authority is that of a senior police officer cannot be trusted to 
secure any data at all.
<P>
Any proposal for key escrow will do nothing to enhance the powers 
of law enforcement to read or intercept messages. If the 
requirement is made that all messages be encrypted with an 
escrow scheme all a criminal has to do is to encrypt an already 
encrypted message. This will have a commercial effect on software 
development for ecommerce in this country to condemn the UK to 
be a software backwater.

Key escrow is a policy with no real technical or other justification. I am
increasingly concerned about the DTI's proposals for the escrow of private
keys. I am unconvinced that any criminal will voluntarily participate in a
key escrow system when extremely strong encryption - not using escrow - will
continue to be freely available for download from the Internet. I am
furthermore concerned about the possibility for abuse of the escrow system,
and the weakening of security surrounding it, particularly when related to
financial transactions and systems security. Key Escrow presents severe
obstacles to the governments' own policy, for example, secure public access
to personal information, and transferral of information over public
networks. I am further concerned about the safeguards and audit tracking to
be implemented in an escrow system to preserve the privacy of the individual
and avoid the potential for misuse. I am concerned that private keys should
not be transferred by any means, physical or electronically, since in so
doing they can be compromised. Finally, I am concerned that for the
government to implement policies affecting such important issues as global
trade and communication that are not unilaterally agreed and implemented may
prove such policies to be by de facto ineffective or at the least damaging
to the economic integrity of the country in the context of international
communication and commerce. These proposals are undoubtedly dangerous for
both the civil liberties of the wider public and the competitiveness of
British industry.

I am a lecturer in law at the University of Bristol, and have been an 
active user of the Internet for the last six years.  I am concerned 
that the plans of the Department of Trade and Industry to introduce 
legislation requiring or encouraging the escrow of private keys will 
infringe basic civil liberties and will do nothing to address the 
problems which the DTI has identified.  In particular, it is basically 
wrong that one medium of communication (via computer) should be 
subjected to stricter controls than others (the post, telex, fax, or 
telephone). It is true that the Interception of Communications Act 
1985 does not cover communications by means other than by post or 
public telecommunications system.  However, the aim of that Act was to 
comply with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  
Arguably, the right to privacy of communications guaranteed by that 
Article should be extended to communications undertaken by other means. 
To the extent that the proposed legislation does the opposite it is to 
be condemned.

The DTI's plans to sponsor the escrow of private keys is a dangerously flawed

As an ex-patriate British citizen working on open international, standards for
(amongst other things) electronic commerce, I view the rumoured proposals for
key escrow in the UK with great concern. I participated in the last DTI public
consultation exercise on encryption and key escrow, and I thought that a
clear message emerged from the summary of all the many dozen responses sent
out afterwards by the DTI - namely, that escrow would discourage British
companies from participating in electronic commerce, and would drive
multi-national companies to base their e-commerce activities elsewhere. I
strongly recommend that the DTI study the responses to that consultation
exercise again, and reflect on the damage it could do to the UK's
international trade position if it attempts to introduce regulations mandating
key escrow.

As an experienced Internet user I am seriously concerned for the future of
British e-commerce if the DTI's plans to sponsor key escrow are realized.  The
Internet is one of the most potent technological innovations of our age, and
it offers wonderful opportunities for businesses across the globe. Over time,
from this fertile environment will emerge winners and losers and it should be
every governments aim to encourage their country's participation in the
e-commerce revolution. Businesses will thrive and flourish in the online arena
if nurtured and encouraged by a sympathetic and enthusiastic legislature.
Please ensure that Britain is free to create an Internet presence of which we
can be proud. Do not adopt a key escrow system - instead work with business to
develop safe, secure and effective e-commerce solutions.

I am deeply concerned that the DTI plans to implement a system of escrow

stifle the growth of electronic commerce by placing an extra layer of
unwanted government intervention on top of the existing infrastructure.
<P>
The primary reason that seems to be cited - to prevent "cybercrime" - is
half-baked at best. In reality cybercriminals will not use government
approved encryption techniques, but will adopt their own from freely
available software, still bypassing government controls.

The Internet grew and continues to grow by virtue of the people and

As a computer scientist, I regard the DTI's proposed support for the escrow of

which could have been easily avoided by consulting any expert in the field. In
my opinion, the plans will have about as much effect on crime as a campaign
asking people to confess at their local police station if they have broken the
law recently, and they represent an unwarranted burden on innocent law-abiding
citizens.

Martin Frost, Programmer, Dynamical Systems Research Ltd

The DTI's plans to sponsor the escrow of private keys in order to facilitate
the police in their fight against cybercrime strikes me as being very
ill-considered, not to say very naive. Apart from giving doughty old

stuff of private lives on suspicion that chummy is up to no good, Burglar

<P>
I'm as concerned as most about the proliferation of paedophile material on
the net, and no doubt as ignorant about other forms of crime perpetrated

both.  With the kind of expertise the DTI is able to call upon, far wiser
methods could be devised.

I work as a software engineer in the telecommunications industry, for
the Canadian company Nortel Networks. I deal with Internet transactions
on a daily basis as part of my job. These very often connect me to
partners all over the world. We implement the highest possible standards
of security in our Internet transactions. I am therefore very concerned
with the up-coming government proposals for a state sponsored key escrow
system. This would effect the way my company does business from this
country immediately. The industry has a well known distrust of any form
of key escrow and any lessening of trust in a business environment could
deal a serious blow to on-line transactions.
<P>
Speaking for myself outside of work, I am also very concerned with other
aspects of the upcoming bill. I wholeheartedly agree with each of the points
in the STAND document, especially the availability of free high level
encryption software from the Internet which would continue to be used by
anyone who wanted to. In effect the government would be spending a very large
sum of money to implement a system that would take years to build, putting us
well behind the government's vision of leading the world in electronic
commerce, and that in the long run would be used only by law-abiding citizens.
<P>
No one I have ever spoken to in the industry supports the idea of key
escrow. Those that are not worried about the government having the easy
ability to read all of their private email are still concerned that
implementing the system would be very expensive, a cost that would no
doubt be passed on to the end user, and actually lesson security
according to all the experts in the field.
<P>
Lastly, if the system is put in place I am very concerned indeed that
there is a proposal that it would be possible to retrieve the escrowed
keys with a simple PACE warrant, unlike the current Home Secretary's
warrant needed for the interception of data transmissions via
telecommunications systems. I also very much agree with STAND that the
best place to discuss the issue of electronic message interception is in
the upcoming review of 1985 Interception of Communications act and not
in a bill designed to promote electronic commerce.
<P>
The government stands a real chance of shooting itself in the foot if it
publishes a document that businesses world-wide will see as the UK
implementing a national system that has high cost and low security.
