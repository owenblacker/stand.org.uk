actually (another plug for the FIPR alerts service) this message (the
97% of the text I recognise) was originally sent on Saturday as soon as
we became aware of this development.

[BTW: the Home Office RIP page still doesn't have a link to the Order]

Anyway - here's the FIPR response:

FIPR Press Release:

FOR IMMEDIATE USE: 10 June 2002

FIPR appalled by huge increase in Government snooping
-----------------------------------------------------

The Regulation of Investigatory Powers (RIP) Act is to be amended before
it even comes into force to dramatically increase the number of official
bodies that can access personal details of phone calls and emails. The
Act was hugely controversial when it went through Parliament in 2000,
with defeats for the Government in the Lords and significant changes
being made to prevent its complete rejection.

Now the powers that were originally only given to the police, customs,
secret services and the taxman are to be made available to a huge range
of Government departments, local authorities, the NHS and even to
Consignia (the Post Office).

Ian Brown, Director of FIPR commented, "I am appalled at this huge
increase in the scope of Government snooping. Two years ago, we were
deeply concerned that these powers were to be given to the police
without any judicial oversight. Now they're handing them out to a
practically endless queue of bureaucrats in Whitehall and Town Halls."

The powers contained in RIP Part I Chapter II allow notices to be served
on telephone companies, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or postal
operators to obtain information such as the name and address of users,
phone numbers called, source and destination of emails, the identity of
web sites visited or mobile phone location data accurate to a hundred
metres or less.

However, this part of the Act has proved to be complex to implement. A
draft Code of Practice only became available for consultation in Autumn
2001 and is still being rewritten to reflect the poor reception it
received. The Government is now suggesting that this process will be
completed by August, but this is only the latest date in a long series
of missed deadlines.

Ian Brown remarked, "The difficulty that the Government has encountered
in getting the right processes in place for the police should make us
ultra-cautious in extending these powers to such a wide range of bodies.
We don't think that there's been enough resources put into the oversight
arrangements for the current proposals, let alone what will be needed
for this huge extension. In practice, these bodies are going to obtain
this personal data on anyone they wish, without any effective way of
checking what they're doing".

He continued, "which websites we visit or where we travel with a mobile
phone in our pocket reveals a great deal of personal information.
Accessing this information needs to be made more difficult, not opened
up to this huge range of new enquirers. I look at this list and wonder
not at who they've added, but if I can possibly think of anyone they've
left out."
