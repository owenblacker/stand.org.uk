"Government is too secretive. Too many decisions are<BR>
taken behind closed doors without proper consultation<BR>
with the public. Government then rushes new laws through<BR>
Parliament and bad legislation is passed. People want to<BR>
be better informed about what government is up to, and be<BR>
consulted more."

<H1>The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill</H1>

<O>... is worse than you thought. Not only does it include government access
to to your private encryption keys, not only does it introduce a range of new
powers for conducting surveillance on the Net, not only does it prevent you
from ever discovering whether your keys or communications are secure:

<P>It's about to become law.

<P>Unlike previous attempts by government, where they have consulted with the
Internet community, RIP is a fast track bill. It's first reading was on
Febuary 11th. It's second reading will be on March 6th. It will be law by
October 4th.

<H1>If you want to stop it, you'll have to act now.</H1>

<H2><A HREF="/ripnotes/">Read our Notes</A></H2>
<P>We've written a guide to the new provisions in the bill that affect Net
users.
<H2><A HREF="/fax1.php3/">Fax your MP</A></H2>
<P>We've opened up our fax engine so you can directly contact your MP, and let
them know of your concerns.

<H2>Tell your friends</H2>
<P>We need the government to realise how many people object to their plans.
Please encourage others to learn about how their liberties will be affected.
